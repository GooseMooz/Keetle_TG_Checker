# Keetle_TG_Checker

I made this project to solve my problem.
When I work at the computer, I'm usually listening to music, so I can't hear when my kettle is done working and I completely forget about it again and again.

So...

Now I can show the area on my webcam where my kettle is, and when it stops working I get a DM in Telegram that it's done!
Designed the algorithm and implemented it by using the OpenCV Python library. I also used Telegram API to send a DM when the process is done, so I can hear it even with music playing.
