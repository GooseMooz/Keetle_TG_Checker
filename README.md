# Keetle_TG_Checker

I made this project to solve my own problem.
When I work at the computer, I'm usually listening to something, so I can't hear when my keetle is done working and I completely forget about it.

So...

Now I can show the area on my webcam where my keetle is, and when it stops working I get DM in Telegram that it's done!
